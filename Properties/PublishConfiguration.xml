	<LongDescription>
I'm a simple man; I see "Loaded {x} mods", I start playing.

This mod adds a **persistent** notification to the Main Menu, showing how many mods have loaded the current session.

The notification will automatically hide once a Game or Editor is loaded.

If for some reason a broken mod prevents other mods from loading, just by looking at the number you can recognize something is wrong.
If you don't see the notification at all, it means no mods were loaded and you need to restart the game.

## Additional features
* Get notified when some maps, savegames or assets have missing CIDs. (Includes automatic backup, original idea by Konsi/Mimonsi)
* Get notified when some of the Setting files are corrupted.
* Get notified when any of your locally installed or published mods includes vanilla DLLs.
* See list of all mods and additional DLLs loaded in the current session.
* Backup and Restore Game Settings and selected Mod Settings.
* Automatically restore settings with values saved to 'Profile 1' on startup.

**IMPORTANT**: It is required to make separate backup manually in Profile 1 for both Game Settings and Mod Settings first time for the Auto Restore to work afterwards.

# By default on exit, the mod folder with missing CIDs and corrupted setting files will be deleted automatically. All additional features are configurable.

## Supported mods for settings backup/restore:
* 529 Tiles, AdvancedSimulationSpeed, All Aboard! (Faster Boarding Mod), Anarchy, AreaBucket, Asset Icon Library, Asset Packs Manager, Asset Variation Changer, AutoDistrictNameStations, Auto Vehicle Renamer, Better Bulldozer, BetterMoonLight, BetterSaveList, Boundary Lines Modifier, Brush Size Unlimiter, Cim Route Highlighter, City Stats, Demand Master Pro [Alpha], Depot Capacity Changer, Extended Tooltip, ExtraAssetsImporter, Find It, First Person Camera Continued, FPS Limiter, Hall of Fame, I18n Everywhere, Image Overlay, Move It, No Pollution, No Teleporting, No Vehicle Despawn, Pathfinding Customizer, Plop The Growables, Realistic Parking Mod, Realistic Trips, Realistic Workplaces And Households, Real Life, Recolor, Road Builder [BETA], Road Name Remover, School Capacity Balancer, Simple Mod Checker Plus, SmartTransportation, Station Naming, Stiffer Vehicles, Sun Glasses, Toggle Overlays, Trading Cost Tweaker, Traffic, Traffic Lights Enhancement Alpha, Traffic Simulation Adjuster, Transit Capacity Multiplier, TransportPolicyAdjuster, Tree Controller, Trips Data, Vehicle Variation Packs, Water Features, Water Visual Tweaks, Whiteness-Toggle (Updated), Zone Color Changer.

Safe to remove anytime.

### Skyve/PDX Mods says less. Why does this mod says more mods than I have?
The way mods are loaded are a little different. What Skyve/PDX Mods is telling you the number of packages you're loading. However, it's possible one mod have more than one "modification" DLL (Dynamic-link Library), such as Harmony or other stuff. This mod checker (and the in-game Mod Initializer) counts them as separate mods, thus the reported value is more than that on the playset. Although, if a DLL of same name is loaded by two separate mods, only one is counted. (Any DLL with names starting with "Colossal." and "0Harmony" are now ignored.
